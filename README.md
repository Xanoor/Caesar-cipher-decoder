# ⚙️Caesar Cipher Decoder

Hi! Here is a small project I created to help me practice Go (Golang)! You can use it to decode Caesar ciphers.

If you want to change the language, modify the dictionary in words.txt.

Have fun!
## Language
![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```git
  git clone https://github.com/Xanoor/Caesar-cipher-decoder
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd EnvCLI
```

Create the executable:

```bash
  go mod init main
  go build
```

You can now run your executable !

Use "main.exe" in the terminal to run it correctly.
